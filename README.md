## How to run the program

1. Ensure you have Java and Gradle installed on your system. I am using JDK11 with gradle 8. If using IntelliJ IDEA you can import .idea file directly from project root and it will automatically setup project for you
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using Gradle:
   ```sh
   gradle build
